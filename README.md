# Amazon-clone
This Amazon Clone project is a fully interactive e‑commerce web application built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, closely replicating Amazon’s shopping and ordering experience. It features dynamic product rendering from a separate data file, displaying ratings, images, and prices in a responsive grid. A real‑time search bar filters products instantly by matching search text against both names and descriptions. The custom cart system allows users to add multiple quantities of products via a dropdown, with contents managed in memory and persisted in localStorage so the cart and badge counts remain after reload. Orders are generated from the cart, saved separately, and displayed in a history view with the most recent orders shown first, each containing product and shipping details. A dynamic “Track Package” feature passes the order and product IDs via URL parameters, enabling the tracking page to display live delivery estimates, product information, and an automatically updated progress bar based on the current date without requiring date plugins. Since the product grid is fully re‑rendered whenever searches or updates occur, all event listeners—such as “Add to Cart”—are re‑attached within each render to maintain functionality. Built without frameworks or libraries, the project demonstrates strong DOM manipulation skills, effective event handling, robust state persistence, and a realistic end‑to‑end order workflow, delivering an Amazon‑like shopping experience completely from scratch with clean, modular JavaScript code.
